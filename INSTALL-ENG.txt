Prerequisites:
    -OMNeT++ 4.1 working installation.
    -Inet project imported. (Tested over inet-20100723)

Installation steps:
    -Extract 802.1ahModel next to the inet project folder.
    -make install

placed together. If this is not your case please type:

make INET_LOCATION=YourInetPATH

If there are not errors, all src files will be placed with your inet src files.
